# Computer Architecture Projects
Here in `Readme.md` will talk about definitions of computer architecture

## Final Project for this course
**8-Bit ALU System**
[Link](https://github.com/Saad711T/8-Bit-ALU-System)

## Definitions :
### Logic Circuit types :
1. Combinational : Adder - Substractor - Decoder - Encoder - Compartor - Multiplexer - Demultiplexer
2. Sequential : Register - Flip Flop - Latches - Counters

### Microoperation :
Operations will performed on data stored in register.
EXAMPLE : **SHIFT - LOAD - CLEAR - INCREMENT**

### RTL
or **Register Transfer Language** Language used to describe transfers between registers
``R2->R1``
and we can add Control function , the register cannot be transfer without success this condition :
``P:R2->R1``

The Register names can be have a meaning :
- `DR` : Data Register
- `IR` : Instruction Register
- `TR` : Temporary Register
- `AC` : Accumlator
- `PC` : Program Counter
